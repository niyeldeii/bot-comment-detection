# Bot Detection Model - Colab Instructions

## Overview

This notebook provides instructions for running the fixed bot detection model in Google Colab. The model has been completely redesigned to address the learning issues in the original implementation.

## Setup Instructions

1. Upload the `bot_detection_project_fixed.zip` file to your Google Drive.

2. Create a new Colab notebook and run the following code to mount your Google Drive:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

3. Install the required packages:

```python
!pip install pandas torch transformers scikit-learn imbalanced-learn joblib
```

4. Extract the project (adjust the path to where you uploaded the zip file):

```python
!unzip /content/drive/MyDrive/bot_detection_project_fixed.zip -d /content/
```

5. Run the training with all the fixes implemented:

```python
# Import the training function
from bot_detection_colab import train_model_colab

# Run the training
history, test_results = train_model_colab()
```

## Key Fixes Implemented

The following critical issues were fixed in the model:

1. **Enhanced Feature Processing**: Each feature type (BERT, numerical, boolean) is now processed separately before combining, allowing the model to learn better representations.

2. **Proper Weight Initialization**: Added Xavier/Glorot initialization for all linear layers to ensure better gradient flow and prevent the model from getting stuck in local minima.

3. **Improved Architecture**: Implemented a more robust architecture with additional layers and proper dimensionality reduction.

4. **Layer Normalization**: Maintained the Layer Normalization after feature concatenation to stabilize feature scales.

5. **Gradient Accumulation**: Added gradient accumulation steps for more stable training.

6. **Optimized Learning Rates**: Adjusted learning rates (BERT_LR=5e-5, LEARNING_RATE=1e-4) and completely removed layer freezing to allow full gradient flow.

7. **Enhanced Regularization**: Adjusted dropout rate (0.3) and weight decay (0.005) for better regularization without hindering learning.

8. **Improved Checkpointing**: Added regular checkpointing every 5 epochs in addition to early stopping.

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the model should now learn properly, showing:

- Decreasing loss values over epochs
- Improving ROC AUC scores (significantly above 0.5)
- Consistent precision and recall metrics
- F1 scores that improve over time

## Visualizing Results

After training, you can visualize the results with:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot training and validation loss
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(history['train_loss'], label='Train Loss')
plt.plot(history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Plot ROC AUC
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(history['roc_auc'], label='ROC AUC')
plt.title('ROC AUC Score')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Plot F1 Score
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(history['f1_score'], label='F1 Score')
plt.title('F1 Score')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Score')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Test Results

The final test results can be displayed with:

```python
print("Test Results:")
for metric, value in test_results.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {value:.4f}")
```
